<body>
    <h1>Voter Registration and Information Update Form</h1>
    <p>Please read instructions carefully. Please type or print clearly with blue or black ink. For further information, you may consult the Secretary of State's website at: <a href="https://VoteOhio.gov">VoteOhio.gov</a> or call 877-SOS-OHIO (877-767-6446).</p>

    <h2>Eligibility</h2>
    <p>You are qualified to register to vote in Ohio if you meet all the following requirements:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You are a citizen of the United States.</li>
        <li>You will be at least 18 years old on or before the day of the general election.</li>
        <li>You will be a resident of Ohio for at least 30 days immediately before the election in which you want to vote.</li>
        <li>You are not incarcerated (in jail or in prison) for a felony conviction.</li>
        <li>You have not been declared incompetent for voting purposes by a probate court.</li>
        <li>You have not been permanently disenfranchised for violations of election laws.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Use this form to register to vote or to update your current Ohio registration if you have changed your address or name.</p>
    <p><strong>NOTICE:</strong> This form must be received or postmarked by the 30th day before an election at which you intend to vote. You will be notified by your county board of elections of the location where you vote. If you do not receive a notice following timely submission of this form, please contact your county board of elections.</p>
    <p>Please see information on back of this form to learn how to obtain an absentee ballot.</p>

    <p><strong>Numbers 1 and 2 below are required by law. You must answer both of the questions for your registration to be processed.</strong></p>

    <h2>Identification Requirements</h2>
    <p>If you have a current Ohio driver's license or state ID card, you must provide that number on line 10. If you do not have an Ohio driver's license or state ID card, you must provide the last four digits of your Social Security number on line 10. If you have neither, please write "None."</p>

    <h2>Residency Requirements</h2>
    <p>Your voting residence is the location that you consider to be a permanent, not a temporary, residence. Your voting residence is the place in which your habitation is fixed and to which, whenever you are absent, you intend to return. If you do not have a fixed place of habitation, but you are a consistent or regular inhabitant of a shelter or other location to which you intend to return, you may use that shelter or other location as your residence for purposes of registering to vote. If you have questions about your specific residency circumstances, you may contact your local board of elections for further information.</p>

    <h2>Your Signature</h2>
    <p>In the area below the arrow in Box 14, please write your cursive, hand-written signature or make your legal mark, taking care that it does not touch the surrounding lines so when it is digitally imaged by your county board of elections it can effectively be used to identify your signature.</p>
